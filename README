NAME
     WWW::NanoRef - Shorten URLs via nanoref.com

SYNOPSIS
     use WWW::NanoRef;

     my $ref = WWW::NanoRef->new({ url => $destination_url });
     my $short_url = $ref->get_short_url;

DESCRIPTION
     This module uses the API published by nanoref.com to produce
     shortened URLs.  So a destination URL like

        http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?newaddr=865+W+El+C
        amino+Real&taddr=2495+S+Delaware+St&csz=Sunnyvale%
        2C+CA+94086&country=us&tcsz=San+Mateo%2C+CA+94403-
        1902&tcountry=us

     becomes a shorter URL like

        http://nanoref.com/yahoo/_QhGlg

METHODS
  new(\%params)
     Creates a new object.  The only key/value pair required is url,
     which is the destination URL you want the shortened URL to
     redirect to.

   Parameters:
    url
         The destination URL you want the shortened URL to redirect to.

    passwd
         The password you want to associated with the nanoref.com URL for
         viewing stats (see http://nanoref.com/ for details) when they
         are implemented.

    test
         If set to a true value, a nanoref.com URL will be generated, but
         will not be stored (and will not work).  It is used for testing
         this module.

  get_short_url()
     Returns a shortened URL that will redirect to the destination
     URL passed to new() when creating the object.  On error, undef
     is returned.

  get_error()
     Returns the error message, if any, from the server.
